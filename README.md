# Adobe Coding Assessment

## Guidance

Thank you for your interest in joining the engineering team at Adobe. As part of your interview process, weâ€™d like you to attempt a brief design and coding exercise that will give you an opportunity to demonstrate your insights and technical capabilities using React. We understand that your time is valuable so in order to maximise the value of your efforts please read the following guidance notes before starting your implementation.

- Review the [specification](SPECIFICATION.md) and make sure you understand the scope of the assessment.
- [React Spectrum](https://react-spectrum.adobe.com/react-spectrum/getting-started.html) has been installed in the application and the UX should use these components (where possible).
- Don't worry about precisely matching the design specification. It's just a tool to define the scope of the proof-of-concept.
- This is your chance to demonstrate the wide range of skills you can bring to the team. **Prioritise code quality over quantity.**
- Be liberal with your code comments, especially when highlighting areas you think we should discuss in your interview.
- **We value your time. We do not expect you to spend any more than two to three hours on your implementation.**
- You shouldn't need to add any new dependencies to the application, but if you do, you may be challenged to rationalise the addition.
- Some service stubs for API calls have been provided in the `api` folder. Your design requirements may not require you to use these so feel free to ignore them if you don't need them. You can also extend the API logic if you wish to create a more realistic scenario.

## Expectations

- Your implementation should follow the design requirements and demonstrate a proof-of-concept.
- Your code must successfully build and all tests should pass.
- Your code must not have any linting issues.

## Completing the assessment

When you're done, raise your changes in your code repository as a Pull Request to the main branch. **Do not push your commits to the main branch**.

Make sure that you have updated the [DESIGN](DESIGN.md) file in the repository with your questions and insights from the Design Assessment.

## Build environment

This skeleton application has been tested using `node` v16.16.0 and `npm` v8.11.0.

## Available Scripts

### `npm start`

Runs the app in the development mode.\
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in your browser.

The page will reload when you make changes.\
You may also see any lint errors in the console.

### `npm test`

Launches the test runner in the interactive watch mode.\
See the section about [running tests](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/running-tests) for more information.

### `npm run build`

Builds the app for production to the `build` folder.\
It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.

The build is minified and the filenames include the hashes.\
Your app is ready to be deployed!

See the section about [deployment](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/deployment) for more information.

### `npm run lint`

Run the linting tool over your code.
